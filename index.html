  <!-- About Section -->
  <section class="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey! I’m Keerthana, a multi-talented Frontend Developer, UI/UX Designer, and Content Creator with a passion for
      solving real-world problems through design and code. Currently pursuing a degree in Electronics and Communication
      Engineering, I specialize in building high-performing, accessible, and responsive web applications using modern
      stacks like React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

      With hands-on experience in UI/UX prototyping, wireframing, and user-centric design using Figma, I bring together
      design and functionality to deliver intuitive digital products.

    <h3>✅ What sets me apart?</h3>

    🔧 Built end-to-end responsive websites with clean architecture and reusable components

    🎨 Designed multiple mobile-first UI/UX projects, including mental health apps, e-commerce clones, and storytelling
    platforms

    📈 Focused on performance optimization, clean code practices, and accessibility (WCAG)

    💡 Strong understanding of design systems, user psychology, and cross-platform consistency

    🤝 Team-oriented mindset with freelance & collaborative project experience

    I'm not just a developer or a designer — I’m a storyteller who crafts meaningful digital journeys. I'm also a driven
    content creator and an aspiring model, inspired by K-pop elegance and visual storytelling.

    💭 My mission is to create digital products that not only work flawlessly — but feel alive.

    Let’s build, design, and dream together 💫.</p>
